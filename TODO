=== TODO

This is a project I dreamed about. A C++ FOX-based application that can be used
to edit a list of inter-dependent tables and fields. All this is saved in a
one-file project file.

Then, we can generate a client-server app based on a C++ backend and a modern
electron frontend that can be used to modify the tables/fields.

If the resulting application must be compiled, it can be from the FOX-based
editor application.
